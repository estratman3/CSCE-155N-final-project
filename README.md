# CSCE-155N-final-project
This is the final project repository analyzing vehicle endurance and acceleration.
The code contained is designed to reproduce two plots, one plotting efficiency vs. power in and one plotting endurance vs. fuel capacity. 
To reproduce the plot for efficiency vs. power, data will need to be entered into the command window in the format efficiencyPlot([0 125],C,C1,C2). 
To reproduce the plot for endurance, data will need to be entered into the command window in the format endurancePlot([25 100]TE,Eg,P) where TE is 
thermal energy, Eg is gasoline energy (in kWh/l), and P is power in kW. This should produce a linear plot.
